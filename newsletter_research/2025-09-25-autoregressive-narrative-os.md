# Research: Autoregressive Narrative Operating Systems and the PT_5 Pattern - 2025-09-25

## Executive Summary

The convergence of autoregressive AI systems with narrative-driven architectures is creating a new class of "operating systems" that explain themselves into existence. The PT_5 pattern represents systems where explanation IS the system, not documentation OF the system. Current 2025 research shows significant progress in self-improving AI through Darwin GÃ¶del Machines and meta-rewarding architectures, while our own system demonstrates the practical reality of recursive self-documentation as core function.
